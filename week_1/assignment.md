# Week 1: Recap of JavaScript Essentials 1 and Intermediate Concepts 

## **Assignment 1: Variables and Data Types**

#### Task:
Create a program that:
1. Declares and initializes variables of different data types (e.g., string, number, boolean, object, array).
2. Prints the type and value of each variable.

#### Tips and Tricks:
- Always use `const` for variables that won’t change and `let` for those that will.
- Remember that arrays and objects are considered `object` types.

### **Assignment 2: Array Manipulations**
#### Task:
1. Create an array of 100 numbers.
2. Perform the following operations:
   - Add a number to the start and end of the array.
   - Remove a number from the start and end of the array.
   - Find the sum of all elements using `reduce()`.

#### Tips and Tricks:
- Use `push`, `pop`, `shift`, and `unshift` for adding/removing elements.

### **Assignment 3: Loops and Iterations**
#### Task:
1. Create an array of student names.
2. Iterate through the array and print each name along with its index.
3. Use a loop to count how many names start with the letter “A”.

#### Tips and Tricks:
- Use `forEach` for simple iteration:
 
- Use `filter` to find names starting with “A”:
- Alternatively, use a `for` loop for more control.

### **Assignment 4: Object Manipulation**
#### Task:
1. Create an object representing a book (with properties like title, author, year, genre).
2. Add a method to the object that prints a summary of the book.
3. Use `Object.keys()` and `Object.values()` to display all properties and their values.

#### Tips and Tricks:
- Define methods inside objects:
- Test the methods by calling them with different inputs.

### **General Problem-Solving Tips**
1. **Break Down the Problem**: Start with smaller, manageable steps.
2. **Use Console Logs**: Print intermediate values to debug and understand the flow.
3. **Refer to Documentation**: Resources like MDN and [javascript.info](https://javascript.info) are invaluable.
4. **Write Clean Code**: Use meaningful variable names and add comments for clarity.
5. **Test Edge Cases**: For arrays, test with empty arrays or arrays with one element. For objects, test with missing properties.
